2. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
3. In VSCode go to *Extensions* and install the *Dev Containers* extension
4. Open the project directory (the one with `.devcontainer` subdirectory in it)
5. VSCode will prompt you to reopen the folder in container. Alternatively you can go to *View > Commands Palette* and look up *Open Folder in Container*
